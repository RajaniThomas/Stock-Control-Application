# Stock-Control-Application
Desktop Application using WPF

The Stock Control Application is a Windows Desktop Application deevloped using WPF that is used to automate a stock count control . It has an easy to use Graphical User Interface that reads contents from a comma separated text file and displays its contents on the screen, in the form of a 
table. Once, the csv file is loaded in the application, the file is also converted into a valid XML file. The application also has the option 
to view the XML files in two different styles in a web browser. 

The table in the Windows form has 4 columns namely; Item code, Item Description, Current Count and On Order.

A user of this application can:
•	Update the ‘Current Count ’ field
•	View columns sorted by ‘Item code’, ‘Current Count’ or ‘On Order’.
•	Select one of the two formats in which the XML file can be viewed in a web browser.

*Before starting the application, place the stocklist.csv, XSLT_Format_1.xslt and XSLT_Format_2.xslt files in the c:\StockFile directory
